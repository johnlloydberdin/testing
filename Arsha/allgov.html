                <p class="space1">Believed by some historians as the place where the first Christian mass in the
                    Philippines was
                    celebrated, Agusan was first referred to by its Malay settlers as "agasan", a word in the dialect
                    meaning "where water flows". This alluded to the presence of a mighty river that traversed the whole
                    area. With the coming of the Spanish conquistadores, the area where flowed a mighty river came to be
                    known as "Agusan" to the civilized world.

                </p>

                <p>
                    The aborigines of Agusan were the ancestors of the present day Mamanwas who were driven to the
                    hinterlands by the first wave of Malay immigrants coming from Borneo and Celebes. These people, in
                    turn, sought the protection of the interior jungles because of the forays and the constant raids of
                    "Moro" pirates.
                    The "Moros", being seafaring people, confined themselves to the coastal areas where they started
                    settlements, leaving the forestall areas to the Manobos. <br><br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Agusan del Norte's claim to being the province where the first mass was held is perpetuated in oral
                    historical traditions whose beginnings date as far back as the latter part of March and early part
                    of April, 1521. Rajah Siagu, the ruler of Agusan, was said to have left his settlement in order to
                    visit his friend Rajah Humabon of Bohol. Together, they visited the ruling rajah of a place called
                    Limasawa where a fleet of Spanish galleons headed by a Portuguese navigator called Fernao Magallao
                    (Fernando Magallanes in Spanish) had just dropped anchor. Rajah Siagu invited the navigator to visit
                    his place, to which Magallanes went and had a mass celebrated on Easter Sunday in what is now called
                    Magallanes (formerly Masao). It is said that Magallanes' ships were given provisions by Siagu for
                    which, in gratitude, his people were exempted later on from paying tribute to the King of Spain.
                    This boon lasted only for sixty years and was taken away when the people rose in revolt against the
                    conquistadores. <br><br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    With the occupation of Spanish troops, came the priest and scholars who immediately started
                    converting the natives. Of the missionaries sent here, the most outstanding was Rev. Saturnino
                    Urios, a Jesuit, who indefatigably set about converting some 23,000 natives during his 28 years in
                    the province. He is oftentimes called the "e;Apostle of Agusan" for his missionary zeal and to honor
                    him, the parochial school of Butuan was named Father Urios College, and presently is called Urios
                    College.
                    Until 1911, Agusan, under the name of Butuan, was part of Surigao province, formerly known as Caraga
                    district. However, following the passage of Act 1693, creating the non-christian provinces, it was
                    separated from Surigao, with the Diwata Mountains as the boundary lines. Before the approval of
                    Republic Act No. 4979 on June 17, 1967 and its proclamation as a province on January 5, 1968, Agusan
                    del Norte was part of the former province of Agusan. <br><br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    The province was under the military rule until 1913. When the Department of Mindanao and Sulu was
                    created under the Secretary of Interior, Agusan became one of the seven provinces comprising the
                    department with Frank W. Carpenter as the first civil governor. <br><br>
                </p>
                <p>In 1914, the first Filipino governor of Agusan was appointed in the person of Teofisto Guingona.
                    <br><br>

                <p>In 1914, the first Filipino governor of Agusan was appointed in the person of Teofisto Guingona.
                    <br><br>
                </p>
                <p>Jose Rosales followed Curato and stayed as governor for two terms. <br><br></p>
                <p>In 1936, Mariano C. Atega was elected governor <br><br></p>

                <p>
                    Then, war broke out. During the Japanese occupation, General Aguirre occupied the governo's post for
                    five months. Liberation came and Curato was again the governor. However, he stayed in the position
                    only for a year. <br><br>
                </p>

                <p>From 1952 to 1959, Felixberto C. Dagani occupied his post. <br><br></p>
                <p>He was succeeded by Democrito O. Plaza who served as governor from 1960 to 1963. <br><br></p>
                <p>Jose C. Aquino took over in 1964 and resigned in 1966 when he ran for Congress. <br><br></p>

                <p>
                    The province then, was administered by OIC Governor Jose T. Gonzales but his term was short lived
                    due to his death in the same year. OIC Governor Jesus S. Delfin was appointed to fill in the vacancy
                    of governorship until he decided to ran for a governatorial candidacy which he lost to Candidate
                    Eduardo L. Rama, Sr., who won in the 1988 election. <br><br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Governor Eduardo L. Rama, Sr., served the province for two terms and after which he ran for
                    Congressman and won.
                    Maria Angelica Rosedell M. Amante-Matba got elected as Provincial Governor in the province of Agusan
                    del Norte for three consecutive terms from 1995 to 2004. Angel ran for Congresswoman and her brother
                    Erlpe John Amante ran for Governor where they also both won their candidacies. On the 2013 and 2016
                    elections, Angel and Erlpe swap again their running posts wherein Erlpe ran for Congressman and
                    Angel bid for Governor where they again both won serving their terms from 2013 up to 2019. <br><br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Dale B. Corvera was then elected governor of Agusan del Norte defeating Juan Miguel Amante in the
                    2019 elections. Marking the first time anyone other than an Amante became governor of the province
                    in more than two decades.
